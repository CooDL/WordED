Technical skills are a must when it comes to tech . But for most people , algorithms and implementation are just a Google search away . That ’s not to say that engineering is just copy-paste — the real engineering comes in figuring out the how and why we build products . So while I gained a lot of experience interning as a software developer , I find my short time as a PM more valuable in terms of self-improvement and general learning as an engineer .
