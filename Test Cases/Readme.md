This small web application just has two modules, the front end `flask_web.py` and the back end `backend.py`. The file `Test Cases for Back End.pdf` can be seen as the unit test cases for the back-end module, whereas the file `Test Cases for Front End.pdf` can be seen as the unit test cases for the front-end module, as well as the integration test cases for this small web app.

1. Test Cases for the Back End (`backend.py`)

   The file `Test Cases for Back End.pdf` contains the test cases for the back end. All these test cases can be run using the script `test_backend.py`.
   
   `$ python3 test_backend.py`

2. Test Cases for the Front End (`flask_web.py`)

   The file `Test Cases for Front End.pdf` contains the test cases for the front end (as well as for the simple integration of the front end and the back end). The test script is skipped as the web application is simple.
